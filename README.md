# Wine_quality_dataset
Problem Description: The objective of this project is to predict the quality of red and white wines based on various physical and chemical properties. The dataset contains a list of attributes such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol and quality ratings. The quality rating ranges from 1 to 10 and represents the overall quality of the wine.
Requirements:
• Analyze and preprocess the dataset to prepare it for training and testing
• Train and evaluate several machine learning models to predict the wine quality ratings
• Select the best model and use it to make predictions on new, unseen data
• Evaluate the performance of the model and make recommendations for further improvements
Deliverables:
• A trained machine learning model that can predict the quality rating of a given wine based on its physical and chemical properties
• A report detailing the performance of the model, including evaluation metrics and recommendations for improvements
